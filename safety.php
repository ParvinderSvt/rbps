 									<p>Dear Students and Parents,<br>
									It is always a pleasure to share our joys, our achievements, our successes, our thoughts with you. Quest for knowledge is unending and the seeds of enquiry sown at home are nurtured in the school.

Looking at the strides the school has taken and the milestones achieved thereof, fills my heart with pride and elation of a gardener whose seeds have sprouted and beaming petals have unveiled.

“All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them.” Walt Disney

The world around us is constantly changing and we are aware that there are many challenges that lie ahead of us as we navigate around this world of changing demands. We shoot for the moon, we know that even if we miss, we will land somewhere among the stars. The need of the hour is to collaborate, innovate and keep growing in order to keep pace with the changes that are inevitable. Education and training today are to be aligned and geared to meet these remarkable challenges.

As a pivotal center of educational excellence, RBPS has always responded proactively to all educational challenges and opportunities alike, continually refurbishing its learning strategies and goals, enabling students to understand and act on issues of global significance and develop competence to investigate the world beyond their immediate environment.

Over the recent years, all approaches to educational reforms in RBPS have been thoughtfully planned to forge a synthesis of academic content and skill development. We infuse the 4Cs of critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity in all our educational practices enabling our students to better meet the dynamics of a global work environment.

We have a talented, dedicated, caring team of staff, each of whom works very hard to ensure that the abilities of the children in our care are nurtured and carefully developed.

RBPS is deeply rooted in the philosophy:-

“A man can be as great as he wants to be. If you believe in yourself and have the courage, the determination, the dedication the competitive drive and if you are willing to sacrifice little things in life and pay the price for the things that are worthwhile, it can be done.” Vince Lombardi

In this age of globalization, survival without new learning is unthinkable. So we must never forget to encourage every effort of the children to improve their every act of generosity and honesty and celebrate even the smallest of achievements. We need to ensure that they take back home something everyday besides homework. That is the ethos of progressive education and that is both our vision as much as our mission in the coming years.

I pray to Almighty that the school scales new heights in the coming years and shines in the galaxy of glory and fame.

Let us look back with pride and move forward with enthusiasm.
