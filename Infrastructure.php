        curriculum is designed to ensure all round development of each student.
        Besides a comprehensive curriculum, a technologically designed
        methodology is introduced at all stages to develop skills required to
        achieve academic success. The medium of instruction is English and
        special emphasis is laid both on written and spoken English at all
        levels. It is obligatory for all students to speak in English within the
        school premises. The scheme of studies is structured and flexible and
        the link between Pre-Primary, Primary, Middle, Secondary and Senior
        Secondary stages is well integrated and phased out.
