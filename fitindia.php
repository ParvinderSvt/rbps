 									 <h4><b>About Fit India Movement</b></h4>
									<!-- <h5>B.Ed M.Ed B.Sc M.Sc</h5>
 									<p>Dear Students, Parents and Well Wishers,</p> -->
									<p>Knowledge will forever govern ignorance. And people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.” James Madison

It is rightly said that “The whole purpose of education is to teach the child to think and not what to think”. We at Radhaballabh Public School believe that this is the fundamental truth and it has always been the endeavour of the school to instill right values in its students so that they develop a holistic personality and are ready to take on the challenges head on once they step out of the gates of the school.

We have set out on an elevating and stimulative journey with the aim of providing our children an exclusive learning experience by teaching them to march ahead with positive attitude, skill, confidence, sensitivity and responsibility.

TThe Fit India Movement, a national initiative led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to instill a culture of physical fitness and wellness across India. It advocates for regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and mental well-being to combat the growing prevalence of obesity and lifestyle-related diseases. Through awareness campaigns, events, and public engagement, the movement encourages people of all ages to prioritize their health and adopt active lifestyles. By promoting sports, yoga, and other physical activities, it seeks to harness India's rich heritage and cultural practices to foster a healthier population. The movement's holistic approach underscores the interconnectedness of physical and mental health, aiming to not only enhance individual well-being but also improve overall societal health outcomes. With a vision for a more vibrant, energetic nation, the Fit India Movement strives to inspire positive lifestyle changes and create a legacy of wellness for future generations.
